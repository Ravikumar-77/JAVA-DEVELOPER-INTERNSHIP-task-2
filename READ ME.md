# Java Developer Internship – Task 2

## Task Title
Variables, Data Types & Console Input Application

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand and implement Java variables, primitive data types, 
console input using the Scanner class, arithmetic operations, type casting, and formatted output. 
The task also demonstrates different variable scopes in Java such as local, instance, and static variables.

## Tools Used
- OpenJDK 25 (LTS)
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows Operating System

## Program Description
- Console-based interactive calculator application
- Demonstrates all Java primitive data types
- Accepts user input using the Scanner class
- Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Handles invalid input using conditional checks
- Demonstrates explicit type casting
- Uses formatted output with `System.out.printf`
- Shows the difference between local, instance, and static variables
- Includes inline comments for better understanding

## Java Concepts Covered
- Primitive data types and memory usage
- Local, instance, and static variables
- Scanner class for console input
- Arithmetic operators
- Type casting (double to int)
- Conditional statements
- Formatted output

## How to Compile and Run
Open terminal in the `src` directory and execute:

```bash
javac CalculatorApp.java
java CalculatorApp


## Sample Input
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 3

# Sample Output
Results:
Sum: 13.00
Difference: 7.00
Product: 30.00
Division: 3.33
Casted Sum (double → int): 13

## Outcome
Successfully built an interactive Java console application
Gained hands-on experience with Java data types and input handling
Understood variable scopes and type casting in Java
